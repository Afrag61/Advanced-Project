defer() and json() with React Router v7
In this section, you learned about the json() utility method and the defer() method.

Both methods are no longer supported / needed when using React Router v7 (check your package.json file).

Instead of using json(), you should construct a Response manually, as shown in this section:

new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Could not fetch events.' }), {
  status: 500,
});
Instead of using defer(), you can directly return an object that contains unresolved promises.

I.e., instead of writing this code:

export async function loader() {
  return defer({
    events: loadEvents(),
  });
}
Use this code with React Router v7:

export async function loader() {
  return {
    events: loadEvents(),
  };
}
Also make sure to remove the defer import at the top of the file.

That's all! No further changes are needed, you still use the <Await> component as shown in this section. And all the other code also stays & works the way you learned it.
